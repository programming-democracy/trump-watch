# About TrumpWatch

This project is a free and open-source compilation of the daily events of 
Trump's administration. It focuses on verifiable, fact-based news and provides
links to respected, mainstream journalism sources. This project is especially
focused on actions that affect civil rights or global stability, or that 
relate to authoritarianism.

## Contribution guidelines

Our goal is to provide 2-5 sources for each listed story, and sources should be from
mainstream, non-partisan news outlets. The first sources in the list will be
short, accessible summaries, followed by more detailed analysis for those who want
more information. Editorials will not be included, though the conclusion of an author 
does not have to be neutral if high-quality, independently verifiable data is included 
to support their analysis.

If "pull request" means something to you, please use that for contributions.  If 
you just said "huh??", send email to 
<a href="mailto:trumpwatch@programmingdemocracy.org">trumpwatch@programmingdemocracy.org</a>.

Spam, harrassment, and diatribes will be promptly filtered to /dev/null.
